    /*
     * For this exercise you need to introduce a new mithra Class.
     * This will represent the AccountLimit.
     * AccountLimit will represent the limit of an account for a particular business date.
     * This should be a DATED object (FROM_Z, THRU_Z, IN_Z, OUT_Z),
     * whose key will be the accountId, and have a double "limit" attribute.
     * A customer can talk to his Bank representative to change his/her account limit,
     * but the change will only take effect from the date of the change onwards,
     * such that any charges for going over the limit that happened in the past
     * can still get calculated after the task.
     *
     *
     * To add the object successfully make sure that:
     *  - You create the xml correctly.
     *  - You get the Mithra Code generator to pick up your xml.
     *  - You register the new object with the mithra runtime config XML
     *    and set the appropriate caching policy for the object.
     *
     *
     * You will need to add test data that will make sense for your tests in:
     *    testdata/data_ObjectFromScratch.txt
     *
     *
     * Add any relationships that make sense.
     * You are encouraged to add the following:
     *  - AccountLimit - CustomerAccount (relationship between dated and non-dated objects)
     *  - AccountLimit - AccountBalance (relationship between two dated object)

// If the customer has two accounts, one which is $5 over the limit
// and the other one is $6 under the limit the result should be 5 - 6 = -1.
